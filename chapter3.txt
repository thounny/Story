The third NAVI is a group of NAVIs in handheld form, or HandiNAVI. Most handheld NAVIs are designed with kids in mind, although adults use them as well. The first in this group is a rectangular model with the same bright red shell as the Child's NAVIs. It's under the hood power is comparable to a Child's NAVI but replaces the keyboard, and speech software with a stylus. It's primary function is an e-mail and chat device which includes live two-way audio transmission. The second handheld is almost identical to the previously described but has a different user interface replacing the stylus with a 'remote controlled car' style device and the small touch screen with VR glasses. The remaining handhelds are simply variants or customized models of the above two.
